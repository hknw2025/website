I am currently a data engineer at the Federal Reserve Board in the Flow of Funds section of the Research and Statistics division. Prior to my almost 2 years of experience as a data engineer, I was a research assistant at the Board. Before coming to the Board, I graduated from Wesleyan University with a major in Economics, and a minor in Data Science, and high honors on my Thesis. I am currently in the process of obtaining my masters in Data Science from Northwestern University. 

My coding language of choice is R, but I also am proficient in SQL, Python, Bash, and Perl. I am working on learning Go in my master's program, and I am excited because I believe it will make me a much better data engineer.
